Q: What are data structures ? 
A: Methods and techniques used to mantain data in a organized fashion and are used to defines relationships and 
   data dependency

Q: Diff between data structure and file structure ?
A: 
    - file structures : are storage on disk only and use the standards file storage policies, low compatibility with external apps
    - data structures : are storage on disk and RAM , has customized policied and high compatibility with externals apps

Q: What is a linkedList ?
A: Is a data structure that consist in a particular entity called Nodes. The nodes has the capability to connect themselves 
with other nodes making a kind of chain. This connection between the nodes is a linked-list.
    [v:p] --> [v:p] --> [v:p]

Q: Where are used ?
A: Are using in any kind of systems that requires handle and solve complex problems

Q: Types of searching used in data structures ? 
A: 
    - linear search : iteration
    - binary search : split the data 

Q: How does binary search works ?
A: Works only in ordered data. Starts dividing the data structure in two chunks and then select a chunk depending on
the search that we need to perform , this process is repeated until find the data that we are finding

Q: How are individual elements access in an array ?
A: By index. The arrays has "n" elements that each has an index to acces, from 0 to n-1. In a multidimensional array
we have to handle multiple index, one for each dimension 

Q: What is a queue in DAta Structures ?
A: Is a data structure used to management a particular way to access the data ( FIFO ) 

Q: What is a binary tree ? 
A: Is a tree data structure where we have a root node with two childrens that are called the right and left sides.
   Each node only can have two direct childrens. Is very useful to perform searching operations

Q: What is the meaning of stack ? 
A: 

Q: What is the working of LIFO ?
A: Correspond to how the data is accesed and modified or updated . LIFO is "Last In First Out"

Q: What is multi-dimensional arrays ? 
A: Dimensional Arrays are a data structures similar to the arrays with the difference of each value is an array.

Q: Are linked lists linear or no linear ?
A: Linked list are consider the best of both worlds here. 
    -> Based on Usage we can say that is not linear
    -> Based on Retrieval strategies I think we can say that are linear

Q: What is a binary search tree ?
A: It consists in two primary nodes from the root node. Values on the left side from the root node are considered
   less than the value of root node and values on the right side are considered higher than root value
 
Q: What is the meaning of FIFO ?
A: First In First Out is like the queues in the real life.
